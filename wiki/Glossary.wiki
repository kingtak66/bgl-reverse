== Block ==

Block consists of a leading big-endian unsigned integer N and following N bytes of data.

Block(x) indicates a Block structure with the length value N consisting of x bytes.

So following code can parse a Block structure:

{{{
# python 3.0 compatible
def parseBlock(data,x):
   """return a tuple (blockdata,tail)"""
  length=parseInt(data[0:x])
  return (data[x:x+length],data[x+length:])
}}}
